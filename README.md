# AirGradient MQTT

This is an Arduino sketch for the AirGradient DIY Air Quality Sensor Pro, PCB version 4.2. 

The base configuration for an AirGradient product is for it to log data to AirGradient's servers. This sketch replaces that functionality with MQTT capabilities to log data to a server of your choice.

## Configuration

TODO - update this section!

Update the `arduino_config.h` file with your details.

- `SECRET_SSID`: WiFi ssid
- `SECRET_PASS`: WiFi password
- `MQTT_SERVER_ADDRESS`: The MQTT server address, you can use `test.mosquitto.org`
- `IP_LAST_CHUNK`: 
- `MQTT_TOPIC`: The MQTT topic that the values will be published to. Recommendation: one topic per device.
- `DEVICE_ID`: A friendly name for your device
- `TEMP_DEVIATION`: The temperature deviation from the sensor to the room. I use 2.5 degrees in my setup. I guess the deviation comes from the heat generated by the board.
- `HUM_DEVIATION`: Same idea as `TEMP_DEVIATION`. I use 2% in my setup. 

## Home Assistant

TODO - update this section!

I use Home Assistant to track and display the sensor status. Define the sensors in your `configuration.yaml` as follows:

```yaml
# Air Gradient sensors
mqtt:
  sensor:
    - name: 'Temperature office'
      state_topic: 'esp/dht/office'
      unit_of_measurement: '..C'
      value_template: '{{ value_json.atmp | round(1) }}'

    - name: 'Humidity office'
      state_topic: 'esp/dht/office'
      unit_of_measurement: '%'
      value_template: '{{ value_json.rhum }}'

    - name: 'CO2 office'
      state_topic: 'esp/dht/office'
      unit_of_measurement: 'ppm'
      value_template: '{{ value_json.rco2 }}'

    - name: 'PM2 office'
      state_topic: 'esp/dht/office'
      unit_of_measurement: 'ppm'
      value_template: '{{ value_json.pm02 }}'
```
