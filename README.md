# AirGradient MQTT

Simple script that reads AirGradient air quality sensors and publishes data to an MQTT server.

I use it along with my DIY AirGradient boards. Information on how to get the components and build the boards is available [here](https://www.airgradient.com/open-airgradient/instructions/diy/) 

This script allows you to host your own solution instead of connecting the DIY Sensor to the AirGradient Dashboard. That's a very convenient option if you don't want to host yourself, you can find all the information you need [here](https://www.airgradient.com/open-airgradient/instructions/diy-connect-to-dashboard/)

Instead of running an HTTP server and polling from Prometheus as in Jeff Geerlingâ€™s solution, I like better the approach of the boards reporting the values to the MQTT server. This code is based on the solution that Jeff describes in [his blog](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/airgradient-diy-air-quality-monitor-co2-pm25)

I'm not using the OLED display to show the values, but you can find the relevant code in the blog post above.

## Configuration

Update the `arduino_config.h` file with your details. I use one config file per device.

- `SECRET_SSID`: WiFi ssid
- `SECRET_PASS`: WiFi password
- `MQTT_SERVER_ADDRESS`: The MQTT server address, you can use `test.mosquitto.org` if you're not running your own MQTT server yet. I use a dockerized Mosquitto MQTT server https://mosquitto.org/
- `IP_LAST_CHUNK`: 
- `MQTT_TOPIC`: The MQTT topic that the values will be published to. I define one topic per device.
- `DEVICE_ID`: A friendly name for your device
- `TEMP_DEVIATION`: The temperature deviation from the sensor to the room. I use 2.5 degrees in my setup. I guess the deviation comes from the heat generated by the board.
- `HUM_DEVIATION`: Same idea as `TEMP_DEVIATION`. I use 2% in my setup. 

## Home Assistant

I use Home Assistant to track and display the sensor status. Define the sensors in your `configuration.yaml` as follows:

```yaml
# Air Gradient sensors
mqtt:
  sensor:
    - name: 'Temperature office'
      state_topic: 'esp/dht/office'
      unit_of_measurement: '..C'
      value_template: '{{ value_json.atmp | round(1) }}'

    - name: 'Humidity office'
      state_topic: 'esp/dht/office'
      unit_of_measurement: '%'
      value_template: '{{ value_json.rhum }}'

    - name: 'CO2 office'
      state_topic: 'esp/dht/office'
      unit_of_measurement: 'ppm'
      value_template: '{{ value_json.rco2 }}'

    - name: 'PM2 office'
      state_topic: 'esp/dht/office'
      unit_of_measurement: 'ppm'
      value_template: '{{ value_json.pm02 }}'
```
