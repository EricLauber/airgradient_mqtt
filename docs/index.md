# AirGradient for Arduino using MQTT

This is an Arduino software implementation for the AirGradient DIY Air Quality Sensor Pro, PCB version 4.2.

The base configuration for an AirGradient product is for it to log data to AirGradient's servers. This sketch augments that functionality with MQTT capabilities to log data to a server of your choice.

I've developed this software to be object oriented. I've applied several modern programming practices such as SOLID and automated testing to a degree that I thought made sense.
